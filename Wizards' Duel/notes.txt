Instance spells are applied once. They have a cost and an effect.
Continuous spells are initiated once with a cost, then they have an additional lighter cost to keep up each turn.

Attack spells affect the opponent, especially targeting HP.
Support spells may affect the opponent, or they may not.
Defense spells have an effect that activates when the castor is attacked.
- Even if they affect the opponent's HP, they don't count as an affecting attack. You can't use a reaction against a defense.

A spell's cost is energy discarded to activate the card.
A spell may have a potential requirement, energy the player needs to still have after discarding cost.
A spell can also have output energy, which is a variable amount of energy to modify damage or other effects. This energy is also discarded
