Instance spells are applied once. They have a cost and an effect.
Continuous spells are initiated once with a cost, then they have an additional lighter cost to keep up each turn.
Investment spells can be given energy over time, then are initiated with the built up energy, or do not need to be initiated.

Each spell can be placed as either an action or a reaction.
Generally a player gets one action on their turn
Reactions can be activated only when targeted (not a reaction)
A reaction affecting the opponent's spell affects either the direct effect or the indirect effect, not both.
A continuous spell cannot be activated if it is already active.

A spell's cost is energy discarded from the mana reservoir to activate the card.
A spell's investment is energy added before activation, which may or may not be discarded during activation

#                 Elements                 #
#------------------------------------------#

There are four basic elements, which can be combined into more advanced elements. 
Each element has its own playstyle if a player chooses to specialize rather than diversifying
Advanced tiers build on the basic components, but they also have their own individual playstyles too
