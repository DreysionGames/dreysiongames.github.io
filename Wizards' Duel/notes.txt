#------------------------------------------#

Instance spells are applied once. They have a cost and an effect.
Continuous spells are initiated once with a cost, then they have an additional lighter cost to keep up each turn.
Investment spells are instance spells that can be given energy over time.
    They are activated with the built up energy, or do not need to be activated (they have a passive effect).

Each spell can be placed as either an action or a reaction.
Alayer gets one action on their turn
One reaction can be activated only when targeted (not a reaction) by a direct effect (not indirect)
Continuous spells may be activated as an action or reaction, but their affect doesn't take effect until afterwards
    They cannot be activated as a reaction and simultaneously used to affect what it's reacting to.
A continuous spell cannot be activated if it is already active.
A continuous spell may affect opponent spells, in which case it may affect the direct or indirect effect--not both.
More than one continuous spell may be active at the same time.

A spell's cost is energy discarded from the mana reservoir to activate the card.
A spell's investment is energy added before activation, which may or may not be discarded during activation

#                 Elements                 #
#------------------------------------------#

There are four basic elements, which can be combined into more advanced elements. 
Each element has its own playstyle if a player chooses to specialize rather than diversifying
Advanced tiers build on the basic components, but they also have their own individual playstyles too
