Super early development obviously. In fact, I only just recently tried using Godot for creating web games for the first time. Glad to see I can get it working!

So the goal of this game is basically you have a hero (or rather, a team of heroes) who go out adventuring on their own. Your input is not necessary (but you can make some decisions anyway, and there are some cases where you would want to). The game runs on its own. Inspiration from [Godville](https://godvillegame.com).

Not ready to be played yet. Have not even worked out the core mechanics. But we're getting there.
